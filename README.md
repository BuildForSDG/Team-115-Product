## About

What is this project about. Ok to enrich here or the section above it with an image. 
This project is about getting African governments, organizations and employeers to embrace and adopt technology which will help in increasing their throughput, lead to an unimaginable economic growth, and accelerated development of the continent. 

## Why
Technology Adoption Advisory Web Application [TAAWA], solves the problems faced by organizations, employers and government entities in process automation and transaction restrictions due to geographical limitations. 
It addresses the 9th of the SDG goals **Industry, Infrastructure and Innovation** and is key to achieving **Smart City** status by African cities.
It is important for African governments, employers and organizations to adopt technology in their day to day activities if they are to stand on equal footings with and/or exceed their international counterparts. 
This project aims to enlighten the above named entities on the available technologies that could lead to a potential growth and improved efficiency of operations and ultimately profit in their various organizations. It also provides advisory services in the technology adoption process with up-to-date contact information of the various makers and an option for technical assistance.

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
